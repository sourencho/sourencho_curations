This was the best dessert I had in Taiwan.\n\t- Make sure to order the oolong shaved ice.\n- [Fuhang Soy Milk](https://goo.gl/maps/FtpBDXUFyMEWwkERA)\n\t- Very popular traditional breakfast spot that serves soy milk (savory and sweet), Chinese pancake with egg and a bunch of fresh bread items like Chinese donut.\n\t- Go early ~9am so that things don't sell out. There is usually a line.\n\t- I would order both types of soy milk, pancake with egg and sesame bread with donut and egg.\n- [Wang's Broth](https://goo.gl/maps/2VDGhDnXD6VMZ2Tx6)\n\t- This is the place you get your braised pork over rice and other delicious braised stuff. I would also order a bunch of sides like the veggies and meat soup.\n\t- Alternative option: [# Huang Ji Braised Pork](https://goo.gl/maps/1CdTyBDJy9Pz1v8y5)\n- [饞食坊](https://goo.gl/maps/xAAngLnqNXQJBwTS9)\n\t- Hip taiwanese style izakaya. Really good meat dishes and nice alcohol options. We got the mullet wine.\n\t- The noodles are really good but spicy.\n- [Hong Shuijiao Beef Noodle Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/bFCHokWRffzAa2G16)\n\t- Didn't try this myself but it was recommended by two friends for beed noddle soup, which is a dish you must have in Taiwan.\n\t- Alternative option: [# Liao Jia Beef Noodle Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/JXUA3Z19NyQrmAZq6)\n- [Raohe Night Market](https://goo.gl/maps/7MokMeMUPWwYjbw67)\n\t- Taiwan is known for it's night markets and this is one of the best ones. Great opportunity to try many dishes like stinky rice, pork rib medicinal soup, black pepper bun and more.\n\t- Check out this Eater article about it: [# Raohe Night Market Is Taipei’s Must-Hit Street Food Destination](https://www.eater.com/2019/3/6/18240098/raohe-night-market-taipei-best-dishes)\n\t- [# 御品元冰火湯圓-台北饒河店](https://goo.gl/maps/MJTvpgyimz1FF8h98) is a storefront there that has amazing tang yuan over ice (sesame balls). Definitely recommend stopping for dessert.\n- [Din Tai Fung Xinyi Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/wWCzgZNSE7E68DRp7)\n\t- A must have in Taiwan and not just for the soup dumplings, everything is amazing there.\n- [Guiji Taipei Nanxi](https://goo.gl/maps/a5HdmS6z87YN5p3M7)\n\t- You can get good boba anywhere really but this is a pretty good one if you happen to be in the neighborhood.\n\t- I got the red oolong milk tea.\n - [Tian Jin Onion Pancake](https://goo.gl/maps/P6s4jpgHa5zhh79Y6)\n\t - Street stall selling fluffy scallion pancake with egg!\n\n## Tainan\n\nTainan is definitely worth doing a trip to via the high speed rail. It's the food capital of Taiwan and has very cute alleys to explore. It doesn't have subway but it's pretty walkable.\n\n- [無名米糕](https://goo.gl/maps/wMm2TkmRfU9RwWbc9)\n\t- My favorite meal in Taiwan was at this little shop in an alley that usually has a line. They serve traditional taiwanese dishes in small bowls.\n\t- Get the sticky rice with minced pork and fish floss rice, oyster vermicelli, milkfish belly vermicelli with soup, one of the noddles, nabeyaki egg noodles, boiled vegetables (yam leaves), pan-fried milkfish belly, a soup and some braised items (bean curd and more).\n\t- I had to copy the chinese characters off the menu onto the little paper they gave me but maybe there is an easier way to order.\n- [BĀN TÊ](https://goo.gl/maps/zY6Py5o7uou67jXG9)\n\t- High quality amazing boba spot. I would get the iced hojicha tea with pearls. They don't make them very sweet so I recommend getting higher than default sweetness.\n- [# 阿江鱔魚意麵](https://goo.gl/maps/caXqUg1jQPHvUfd36)\n\t- I didn't get to go here but it was recommended as a good spot to try Tainanese eel noodles.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T01:32:28.761213661Z","tags":null}}
