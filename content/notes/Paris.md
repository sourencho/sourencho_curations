	- One of my favorite restuarants in the world. Innovitive, homemade style food cooked with French, Middle Eastern, American and Japanese flavors run by a cool couple.

	- Delicious Moroccan couscous dishes that come with broth, vegetables, chickpeas and grapes.
	- I got the lamb shank but it was a bit too big for me.

	- Amazing seafood in a modern, busy restuarant. You will have to wait but it'll be worth it for the delicious urchins, clams, crab and more that come with the seafood platter!
