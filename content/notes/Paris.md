#### Food

-  [Mokonuts](https://goo.gl/maps/TbrHCQ1zALjf5QYv7)
	- One of my favorite restuarants in the world. Innovitive, homemade style food cooked with French, Middle Eastern, American and Japanese flavors run by a cool couple.
- [Le Tagine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j8jyNniFNVsrbNc39?g_st=ic)
	- Delicious Moroccan couscous dishes that come with broth, vegetables, chickpeas and grapes.
	- I got the lamb shank but it was a bit too big for me.
- [Clamato](https://goo.gl/maps/6y1WE88E3o89sS9n6)
	- Amazing seafood in a modern, busy restuarant. You will have to wait but it'll be worth it for the delicious seafood platter with urchins, clams, crab and more!
- [Ethiopia Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GL37hry4PXidkrfc9?g_st=ic)
	- Great Etheopian food. Better than the places I've had in the states.
	- Very easy to order, you just get the combo.
- [Deviant]()
	- Natural wine bar with amazing Italian tapas. Gets busy so try to snag a table right when it opens. Order bottles not glasses ;)
	- If it doesn't work out, try [Vivant 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZcHMSDWtAZdrYz7PA?g_st=ic) down the street.
- [Du Pain et des Idées](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K2fr3m1DXFCx6kqr7)
	- Old school pastry shop with flakey delicious croissants and other pastries. Some savory ones too~

- [Bistrot Paul Bert](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UXva4NNjwck1chnq9?g_st=ic)*
