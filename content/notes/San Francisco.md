## Food
- [La Palma Mexicatessen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zwfxTpAXYvPGsZHq5)
	- My favorite spot in SF! High quality but not fancy mexican food. Very clean burrito but I usually get the enchiladas with pollo en salsa. They also usually have a good drink option. Make sure to buy a handful of chicharron on the way out.
- [Suppenkuche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tEtLS6y2KkZJDDVu6)
